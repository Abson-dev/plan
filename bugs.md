Plan is quite a crude package. Please do what you can to improve it, by
reporting bugs (and possible enhancements) at the <a
href="http://github.com/dankelley/plan/issues">github issues site</a>.  Below
are some hints for writing great reports.


1. Submit an issue for each topic. This makes it easier for the developer to
   help you (and others who have the same problem). Issues that contain
sub-issues get confusing very quickly.

2. The issue subject line should be clear, and written in such a way as to
   suggest a criterion for closing the issue. For example, `"Improve gantt
diagrams"` is not as good as `"Gantt time axis has numbers cut off at RHS
side"`.
    
3. Respond to comments using the Github site, not by replying to email from
   Github. The problem with mail is that many people have it set up to include
previous discussion (which is a useless distraction on the Github issue page)
or to include contact information that is likely best left private.

4. Provide sample code so that the developer can spend time addressing your
   issue, not trying to reproduce it. Use the <a
href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code">Github
markup method</a> for code fragments. It is best to use a built-in dataset,
also you may also email private data Dan.Kelley@Dal.Ca.

5. Close your issue when it has been addressed.  Typically, when the developer
   thinks an issue has been addressed, he posts a comment in which he asks the
reporter to check the new version and either close the bug or explain the
remaining problems.

6. Learn how to build plan from source, because most bugs will be solved by the
   developer changing the source on Github. See the "Installation" tab.

7. If you see something you can help with, please do so. Any github user can
   add to an issue report.</li>
