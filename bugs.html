<p>Plan is quite a crude package. Please do what you can to improve it, by
reporting bugs (and possible enhancements) at the <a
href="http://github.com/dankelley/plan/issues">github issues site</a>.  Below
are some hints for writing great reports.</p>

<ol>

    <li>Submit an issue for each topic. This makes it easier for the developer
        to help you (and others who have the same problem). Issues that contain
        subissues get confusing very quickly.</li>

    <li>The issue subject line should be clear, and written in such a way as to
        suggest a criterion for closing the issue. For example, "Improve gantt
        diagrams" is not as good as "Time axis in Gantt diagram has numbers cut
        off at RHS side if time interval >2y".</li>
    
    <li>Respond to comments using the Github site, not by replying to email
        from Github. The problem with mail is that many people have it set up
        to include previous discussion (which is a useless distraction on the
        Github issue page) or to include contact information that is likely
        best left private.</li>

    <li>Provide sample code so that the developer can spend time addressing
        your issue, not trying to reproduce it. Use the <a
            href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code">Github
            markup method</a> for code fragments. It is best to use a built-in dataset,
        also you may also email private data Dan.Kelley@Dal.Ca.</li>

    <li>Close your issue when it has been addressed.  Typically, when the
        developer thinks an issue has been addressed, he posts a comment in
        which he asks the reporter to check the new version and either close
        the bug or explain the remaining problems.</li>

    <li>Learn how to build plan from source, because most bugs will be solved
        by the developer changing the source on Github. See the "Installation"
        tab.</li>

    <li>If you see something you can help with, please do so. Any github user
        can add to an issue report.</li>

</ol>
