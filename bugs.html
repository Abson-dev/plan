<p>Report bugs (and possible enhancements) at the <a
    href="http://github.com/dankelley/plan/issues">github issues site</a>.<p>
<p>Hints for writing good bug/enhancement reports:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Submit an issue for each topic, to make it easier for the developer to
        help. (Issues that contain subissues get confusing very quickly.)</p>
<li>The subject line should be clear, and written in such a way as to suggest a criterion for
closing the issue. For example, "Improve gantt diagrams" is not as good as
"Time axis in Gantt diagram has numbers cut off at RHS side if time interval
exceeds 2 years".
<li>Provide sample code. Use the <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code">Github markup method</a> of indicating code, to make it clearer. Either use a built-in dataset (the best) or email your data to Dan.Kelley@Dal.Ca. Do not post data here unless you are comfortable with it being public.
<li>Either learn how to work with Github email or (better) respond on the Github site. (A problem with using the mailer is that mail programs typically include the whole thread, which fills the Github web interface with a lot of unnecessary copies. Another problem is that mail applications often include information that you probably don't want published on Github (e.g. email
    or physical addresses, phone numbers, etc).
    <li> Be patient with the developer, for <code>plan</code> is not a professional thing -- it's just something written for a personal need, and shared in the hopes that it can help others.
    <li> If you see something you can help with, please do so. Any github user can add to an issue report.
</ol>
