<p>Plan is quite a crude package. Please do what you can to improve it, by
reporting bugs (and possible enhancements) at the <a
href="http://github.com/dankelley/plan/issues">github issues site</a>.  Below
are some hints for writing great reports.</p>

<ol>

    <li>Submit an issue for each topic. This makes it easier for the developer
        to help you (and others who have the same problem). Issues that contain
        subissues get confusing very quickly.</li>

    <li>The subject line should be clear, and written in such a way as to
        suggest a criterion for closing the issue. For example, "Improve gantt
        diagrams" is not as good as "Time axis in Gantt diagram has numbers cut
        off at RHS side if time interval exceeds 2 years".</li>

    <li>Provide sample code. Use the <a
            href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code">Github
            markup method</a> of indicating code, to make it clearer. Either
        use a built-in dataset (the best) or email your data to
        Dan.Kelley@Dal.Ca. Do not post data here unless you are comfortable
        with it being public.</li>

    
    <li>Either learn how to work with Github email or (better) respond on the
        Github site. Mail is often set up to retain previous content, and that means
        that the Github view of the issue gets repetitive. (Another problem is
        that many people have mail set up to include personal information, e.g.
        mailing addresses and phone numbers, that does not belong on the
        web.)</li>


    <li> It is best that reporters will close issues, not the developer.
        Typically, when the developer thinks an issue has been addressed, he
        posts a comment to that effect, asking the reporter to check, and
        either close the bug or discuss remaining problems. This speeds the
        path to solution.</li>

    <li> If you see something you can help with, please do so. Any github user
        can add to an issue report.</li>

</ol>
