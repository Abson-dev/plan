<p>Plan is quite a crude package. Please do what you can to improve it, by
reporting bugs (and possible enhancements) at the <a
href="http://github.com/dankelley/plan/issues">github issues site</a>.  Below
are some hints for writing great reports.</p>

<ol>

    <li>Submit an issue for each topic. This makes it easier for the developer
        to help you (and others who have the same problem). Issues that contain
        subissues get confusing very quickly.</li>

    <li>The subject line should be clear, and written in such a way as to
        suggest a criterion for closing the issue. For example, "Improve gantt
        diagrams" is not as good as "Time axis in Gantt diagram has numbers cut
        off at RHS side if time interval exceeds 2 years".</li>

    <li>Provide sample code. Use the <a
            href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code">Github
            markup method</a> of indicating code, to make it clearer. Either
        use a built-in dataset (the best) or email your data to
        Dan.Kelley@Dal.Ca. Do not post data here unless you are comfortable
        with it being public.</li>

    
    <li>Either learn how to work with Github email or (better) respond on the
        Github site. (A problem with using the mailer is that mail programs
        typically include the whole thread, which fills the Github web
        interface with a lot of unnecessary copies. Another problem is that
        mail applications often include information that you probably don't
        want published on Github (e.g. email or physical addresses, phone
        numbers, etc).</li>


    <li> In the <code>plan</code> project, it is assumed that reporters will
        close issues, not the developer. Typically, when the developer thinks
        an issue has been addressed, he posts a comment to that effect, asking
        the reporter to check. If no new comment appears within about 3 days,
        he will ask a second time. Then, if nothink appears for another few
        days, he will close the issue, if he thinks it has been addressed. This
        imposes a burden on the developer that repoerters can easily alleviate
        -- when Github sends an email indicating that you should check the
        issue, either do so or post a note indicating that you need a week (or
        whatever) before you can do so.</li>

    <li> If you see something you can help with, please do so. Any github user
        can add to an issue report.</li>

</ol>
