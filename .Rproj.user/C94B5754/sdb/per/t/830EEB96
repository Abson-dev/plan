The format is simple.  The x axis represents time, ranging from the\nonset of the project to the deadline for completion.  The y axis represents the\nremaining effort that is require to accomplish the work. As the work is carried\nout, the chart provides a running summary of progress towards the deadline.  If\nwork is proceeding smoothly according to schedule, the chart takes the form of\na triangle, with the remaining effort falling from its initial value to zero at\nthe deadline. For guidance, a gray line is drawn to indicate this ideal\nsituation. If work is being accomplished faster than expected, the data will\nlie below this gray line. However, if the project is falling behind schedule,\nthe data line will lie above the ideal line.  Thus, a glance at the chart\nindicates whether the deadline can be met.  In most cases, the work is divided\ninto sub-tasks, and the remaining effort in each task is shown with a different\ncolour in the chart. This is helpful in identifying tasks that may need more\nattention.\n\nThe following plots the burndown chart\n```{r}\nlibrary(plan)\ndata(burndown)\nplot(burndown)\n```\nTo work with your own files, use \\code{\\link{read.burndown}}.\n\n# Gantt charts\n\nGantt diagrams^[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_Chart] indicate a timetable\nfor completion of the components of a project. The sample dataset `gantt` is a\nhypothetical research plan for an MSc project; you can see how it is graphed\nwith `demo(gantt)` or `example(plot.gantt)`.\n\nThe following plots the Gantt diagram.\n```{r}\nlibrary(plan)\ndata(gantt)\nplot(gantt)\n```\nTo work with your own files, use \\code{\\link{read.gantt}}.\n\n",
