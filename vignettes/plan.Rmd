**Abstract.** The `plan` package provides functions for planning and
describing projects and monitoring the progress towards completions of
individual tasks within projects.

# Introduction

This package provides (mainly graphical) tools for the planning of projects.
This is an early version of the package, providing support for burn-down
charts and Gantt diagrams.


# Burn-down charts

Burndown
charts^[http://alistair.cockburn.us/crystal/articles/evabc/earnedvalueandburncharts.htm]
are used to display a time series of the progress towards the goals of a
project.  The format is simple.  The x axis represents time, ranging from the
onset of the project to the deadline for completion.  The y axis represents the
remaining effort that is require to accomplish the work. As the work is carried
out, the chart provides a running summary of progress towards the deadline.  If
work is proceeding smoothly according to schedule, the chart takes the form of
a triangle, with the remaining effort falling from its initial value to zero at
the deadline. For guidance, a gray line is drawn to indicate this ideal
situation. If work is being accomplished faster than expected, the data will
lie below this gray line. However, if the project is falling behind schedule,
the data line will lie above the ideal line.  Thus, a glance at the chart
indicates whether the deadline can be met.  In most cases, the work is divided
into sub-tasks, and the remaining effort in each task is shown with a different
colour in the chart. This is helpful in identifying tasks that may need more
attention.

The following plots the burndown chart
```{r}
library(plan)
data(burndown)
plot(burndown)
```

# Gantt charts

Gantt diagrams^[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_Chart] indicate a timetable
for completion of the components of a project. The sample dataset `gantt` is a
hypothetical research plan for an MSc project; you can see how it is graphed
with `demo(gantt)` or `example(plot.gantt)`.

The following plots the Gantt diagram.
```{r}
library(plan)
data(gantt)
plot(gantt)
```
