<p>An official version of plan is supplied on CRAN, and it may be installed with</p>
<pre>
install.packages("plan")
</pre>
<p> within an R session.  To get the newest version (still in development), use</p>
<pre>
install_github("dankelley/plan", ref="development")
</pre>
<p>If the previous fails, you may need to install the <code>devtools</code> package, with</p>
<pre>
install.packages("devtools")
</pre>
<p>which is a step you won't need to repeat unless you un-install <code>devtools</code>.</p>
